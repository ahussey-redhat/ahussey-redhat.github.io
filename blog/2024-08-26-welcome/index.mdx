Hello and welcome to my blog + documentation website!

As a quick intro, my name is Alex Hussey. I'm a Solution Architect with Red Hat, and based in Canberra, Australia.
I am an Open and Public Source advocate, with a passion for cloud native application development.
My background is heavily on the infrastructure side of things, from traditional application deployment on physical servers, through to CI/CD and Service Meshes deployed on Kubernetes.
I heavily rely on automation tools such as Ansible Core, and Ansible Automation Platform to achieve my desired states.
This becomes evident if you look at any of my GitHub repos that have a `-infra` suffix.

What's next?
Well, throughout my career I have used various programming languages to script and create applications that generally have a infrastructure focus.
Writing programs and scripts has always created an enjoyable puzzle for me through learning the different syntaxes, semantics and best practices, as well as translating the challenge into a code-able solution.

Through this interest, I started writing applications to solve real life challenges. An example of this, is when my work sent out a challenge:
> Create a silent auction application in three weeks

I saw this as an opportunity to further my skills in a particular language (Java), as well as get a better understanding of full application development workflows.
Thankfully I had a mentor [@tim-stasse](https://github.com/tim-stasse), who was able to part some of his wisdom to me.

You can see the resulting application via the following QA preview:
